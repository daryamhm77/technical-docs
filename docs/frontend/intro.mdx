## Why It Exists

We keep the UI fast, accessible, and predictable. This doc gives the least you need to align with existing patterns before contributing.

## Project Skeleton

- `src/` hosts everything; no logic lives outside it.
- `components/` holds reusable pieces paired with styles and tests.
- `pages/` defines routing surfaces; move domain logic into helpers or services.

## Minimal Style Rules

- Keep components single-purpose and under ~150 lines.
- Prefer tokens or CSS variables over hard-coded colors.
- Ensure every interactive element is keyboard reachable and announced with ARIA labels when needed.

## Tooling

- Bundled with Vite + TypeScript; run `npm run lint` before any PR.
- Shared HTTP logic stays inside `src/services/` to keep fetch code uniform.

## Quickstart

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run dev`
3. Visit `http://localhost:5173`

Stay consistent, stay minimal. That’s the frontend contract.
